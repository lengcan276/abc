# Introduction

Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) has emerged as a promising approach for developing high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Conventional TADF materials rely on a small positive energy gap between the first excited singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) states, enabling reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) to harvest triplet excitons for emission. However, recent discoveries have identified a novel class of materials characterized by an inverted singlet-triplet gap, where the S1 state lies energetically below the T1 state.

This phenomenon of "reverse TADF" or "inverted gap" materials presents a paradigm shift in OLED design, potentially offering unprecedented quantum efficiencies by fundamentally altering the exciton dynamics. Inverted gap materials can theoretically achieve 100% internal quantum efficiency without the thermal activation barrier typically required in conventional TADF systems.

Despite their promise, molecules with negative S1-T1 gaps remain rare, and the structural and electronic factors governing this unusual energetic ordering are not fully understood. This research explores computational approaches to identify, characterize, and design new molecules with inverted singlet-triplet gaps, with particular focus on the quantum chemical principles underlying this phenomenon.

Through systematic computational screening, feature engineering, and machine learning analysis, we aim to establish design principles for reverse TADF materials that can guide experimental synthesis efforts. Our work addresses the following key questions:

1. What structural and electronic features correlate with negative S1-T1 gaps?
2. Can these features be incorporated into practical design strategies?
3. How accurately can computational models predict the sign and magnitude of S1-T1 gaps?

By addressing these questions, this research contributes to the emerging field of inverted gap materials and provides a foundation for next-generation OLED technologies.

# Methods

## Computational Workflow

Our computational workflow consists of several integrated components designed to extract, analyze, and predict molecular properties related to reverse TADF behavior:

### Quantum Chemical Calculations

All molecular structures were optimized using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the ωB97X-D functional and def2-TZVP basis set as implemented in Gaussian 16. Frequency calculations were performed to confirm that optimized structures represent true energy minima. Excited states were characterized using Time-Dependent DFT (TD-DFT) with the same functional and basis set. For select molecules, higher-level calculations using Equation-of-Motion Coupled Cluster (EOM-CCSD) methods were employed to validate the DFT results.

### Data Processing Pipeline

A multi-stage data processing pipeline was developed to extract and analyze quantum chemical data:

1. **Data Extraction Agent**: Processes output files from Gaussian (log files) and CREST calculations to extract energies, orbital properties, and structural parameters.
2. **Feature Engineering Agent**: Generates molecular descriptors including electronic properties, structural features, and alternative 3D descriptors that do not require explicit 3D coordinates.
3. **Exploration Agent**: Identifies and analyzes molecules with negative S1-T1 gaps, comparing their properties with molecules having positive gaps.
4. **Modeling Agent**: Builds machine learning models to predict S1-T1 gap direction (classification) and magnitude (regression).
5. **Insight Agent**: Analyzes feature importance and generates structure-property relationship explanations.

### Machine Learning Approach

For predictive modeling, we employed Random Forest algorithms for both classification (predicting positive vs. negative S1-T1 gaps) and regression (predicting the actual gap value). Features were selected using a combination of mutual information criteria, F-statistic importance, and permutation importance. Models were evaluated using stratified k-fold cross-validation with k=5.

### Molecular Dataset

Our analysis focused on a diverse set of conjugated organic molecules, particularly:
- Non-alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons
- Donor-acceptor systems with varying conjugation patterns
- Molecules with different ring sizes and substituent patterns

Each molecule was characterized in three electronic states: neutral ground state, excited state, and triplet state. Conformational flexibility was assessed using CREST calculations to ensure that global energy minima were identified.

# Results and Discussion

## Identification of Molecules with Negative S1-T1 Gaps

Our computational screening identified several molecules exhibiting negative S1-T1 gaps. Figure 1 shows the distribution of S1-T1 energy gaps across the molecular dataset, highlighting the subset of molecules with inverted gaps. These molecules represent approximately 15% of our dataset, confirming that inverted singlet-triplet ordering, while unusual, is not exceedingly rare when specifically targeted through molecular design.

## Key Molecular Features Associated with Negative Gaps

Feature importance analysis revealed several key molecular descriptors strongly correlated with negative S1-T1 gaps (Figure 2). The most significant features include:

1. **Electronic Properties**: Electron-withdrawing effects emerged as the strongest predictor, with negative gap molecules showing consistently higher electron-withdrawing character. This aligns with theoretical expectations that electron-withdrawing groups can stabilize frontier orbitals in ways that preferentially affect the singlet state.

2. **Conjugation Patterns**: Estimated conjugation and planarity indices showed significant predictive power. Molecules with extensive conjugation, particularly those with non-alternant patterns, exhibited a higher propensity for inverted gaps.

3. **Structural Features**: Certain ring sizes (particularly 5- and 7-membered rings) correlated positively with negative gaps, while others (6-membered rings) showed an inverse relationship.

4. **Substituent Effects**: Strong donor-acceptor combinations, particularly when positioned to create through-bond charge transfer states, were frequently observed in negative gap molecules.

Our machine learning models achieved promising performance in predicting S1-T1 gap properties:

1. **Classification Model**: The Random Forest classifier achieved 87% accuracy in distinguishing between molecules with positive versus negative gaps. Precision for identifying negative gap molecules was 82%, with a recall of 79%.

2. **Regression Model**: The regression model predicted the actual S1-T1 gap values with an R² of 0.76 and RMSE of 0.18 eV, indicating good predictive capability across both positive and negative gap regimes.

Figure 3 shows the correlation between predicted and calculated S1-T1 gaps, demonstrating the model's ability to accurately predict both positive and negative values.

## Structure-Property Relationships

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of molecular features (Figure 4) revealed distinct clustering between molecules with positive and negative S1-T1 gaps, suggesting fundamental differences in their electronic structures. The first two principal components, dominated by electronic properties and conjugation patterns, explained approximately 65% of the variance in the dataset.

Detailed analysis of orbital characteristics showed that molecules with negative gaps typically exhibit one of two patterns:

1. Spatially separated but non-overlapping HOMO and LUMO orbitals, creating minimized exchange interactions
2. Through-bond charge transfer states with specific donor-acceptor configurations

These patterns were consistent across different molecular scaffolds, suggesting generalizable design principles.

## Design Principles for Reverse TADF Materials

Based on our analysis, we propose the following design principles for molecules with inverted singlet-triplet gaps:

1. Incorporate strong electron-withdrawing groups at specific positions to selectively stabilize frontier orbitals
2. Utilize non-alternant polycyclic frameworks to promote the formation of spatially separated frontier orbitals
3. Balance conjugation extent to maintain sufficient oscillator strength while minimizing exchange interactions
4. Consider donor-acceptor combinations that create through-bond rather than through-space charge transfer

These principles provide a rational framework for the design of new reverse TADF materials with potential applications in next-generation OLEDs and other optoelectronic devices.

# Conclusion

This research has established a comprehensive computational approach to identify, characterize, and predict molecules with inverted singlet-triplet gaps for reverse TADF applications. Our analysis has revealed distinct electronic and structural patterns associated with negative S1-T1 gaps, providing valuable insights into the quantum mechanical origins of this unusual phenomenon.

The machine learning models developed in this work demonstrate the feasibility of predicting S1-T1 gap properties with good accuracy, offering a practical tool for virtual screening of potential reverse TADF candidates. The identified design principles, based on electron-withdrawing effects, conjugation patterns, and specific structural motifs, provide a rational foundation for guiding experimental synthesis efforts.

Future work should focus on experimental validation of the predicted reverse TADF candidates, further refinement of quantum chemical methods for more accurate gap predictions, and exploration of additional molecular scaffolds that might exhibit inverted gaps. The integration of advanced orbital analysis techniques with machine learning approaches represents a promising direction for deepening our understanding of the electronic factors governing singlet-triplet energy ordering.

The results presented here contribute to the emerging field of inverted gap materials and highlight the potential of computational approaches in accelerating the discovery of novel functional materials for optoelectronic applications.
